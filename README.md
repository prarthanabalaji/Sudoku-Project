Hello! Welcome to the Solve Your Sudoku Project. This project solves any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm in C.

Motivation:
I built this project because I noticed many jobs nowadays require knowledge in C. This project served as a way for me to get introduced to the world of C and continue to expand from this point on. Since I am a beginner in C I utilized online resources and Youtube tutorials to build this project.

Design Process:
I began building this project by first clearly understanding how a Sudoku puzzle works. I had to account for the fact that there could not be a repition of numbers in a specified row and column and the 3x3 grids within the larger 9x9 grid. Then I began by formatting the puzzle. By allocating a function just to print grid design and output the original puzzle inputted by the user I was able to modularize my code to work efficiently. I followed this same idea for the rest of my code as I worked through functions that solved the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm and validated each move to ensure the guesses followed the rules.

Conclusion:
Overal, this project gave me a solid understanding how programming in C works by introducing me to basic syntax, writing functions, and incoporating algorithms to solve complex problems.
